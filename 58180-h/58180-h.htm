<p>The writer cannot but feel flattered with
the reception given to the <em>First Series</em> of “My
Knitting Book,” and also to her other volumes on
Decorative Needlework:&mdash;and she deems that their
general correctness and utility are proved by the
translations made of them into the Continental
languages, and by their verbatim republication in
America.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">iv</a></span></p>

<p>Since the publication of the first edition of the
present series, the whole of the examples have been
carefully reworked, and the faults of the first impressions
have been corrected; yet, it is not to be
wondered at, in a work of this description, that
errors&mdash;notwithstanding every precaution&mdash;should
occasionally creep in. Hence the writer will be
much indebted for corrections of any mistakes that
may be discovered by ladies using these books; she
cannot, however, attend to anonymous communications,
or to such as relate to supposable errors arising
from misunderstanding on the part of the Knitter.</p>

<h2>Introduction.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop_cap drop_cap1" src="images/i.png" alt="I" />
</div>

<p class="drop_cap">I<span class="looks_big">t</span> has been justly observed that,
“an art cannot be taught but by
its proper terms.” In the art of
knitting, various terms have been
employed&mdash;whether correctly, or
not, it is here needless to inquire&mdash;to
designate the same simple process.
Confusion has necessarily
been the result. Those who are accustomed
to follow the technicalities of one writer on
knitting, are not unfrequently perplexed to
comprehend the directions of another, however
clearly and concisely they may be laid
down. Hence, in the <em>first series</em> of the pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>sent
treatises, the writer confined herself to
the use of the technical terms most generally
employed by adepts in the art, and which appeared
to be those most easy of comprehension.
The following directions, therefore,
will be conveyed in the same phraseology;
but, for ease of reference, and for the use of
those who may not possess the former series,
it has been deemed expedient to repeat the&mdash;</p>

<h2 class="clear">Explanation of Terms used in Knitting.</h2>

<p><i>To cast on.</i>&mdash;To make the first interlacement
of the thread on the needle.</p>

<p><i>To cast off.</i>&mdash;To knit two stitches, and to
pass the first over the second, and so on, to the
last stitch, which is to be secured by drawing
the thread through.</p>

<p><i>To pearl.</i>&mdash;To knit a stitch with the thread
before the needle.</p>

<p><i>To narrow.</i>&mdash;To lessen, by knitting two
stitches together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span></p>

<p><i>To widen.</i>&mdash;To increase by making a stitch,
bringing the cotton round the needle, and
knitting the same when it occurs.</p>

<p><i>A Turn.</i>&mdash;Two rows in the same stitch,
backwards and forwards.</p>

<p><i>A Row.</i>&mdash;The stitches from one end of the
needle to the other.</p>

<p><i>A Round.</i>&mdash;A row, when the stitches are on
two, three, or more needles.</p>

<p><i>A plain Row.</i>&mdash;That composed of simple
knitting.</p>

<p><i>To pearl a Row.</i>&mdash;To knit with the thread
before the needle.</p>

<p><i>To rib.</i>&mdash;To work alternate rows of plain,
and pearl, knitting.</p>

<p><i>To bring the thread forward.</i>&mdash;To <em>make</em> a
stitch, by bringing the thread forward, after
a <em>knitted</em> stitch.</p>

<p><i>To pass the thread over.</i>&mdash;To <em>make</em> a stitch,
by passing the thread over the needle, after a
<em>pearled</em> stitch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span></p>

<p><i>To make a stitch.</i>&mdash;If after a <em>knitted</em> stitch,
this is done by bringing the thread forward;&mdash;if
after a <em>pearled</em> stitch,&mdash;by passing the thread
over.&mdash;To make a stitch <em>between two pearled</em>
stitches, the thread must be turned round the
needle; that is,&mdash;passed over the needle, and
brought again in front; but, to make a stitch
between a <em>pearled</em> stitch and a <em>knitted</em> stitch,&mdash;the
thread must only be passed over the
needle.</p>

<p><i>To turn the thread round the needle.</i>&mdash;If
the thread is before the needle, to pass it over
the needle, and bring it again in front.</p>

<p><i>To bring the thread forward twice.</i>&mdash;To
bring the thread forward, and then, by turning
it round the needle, to bring it forward again.</p>

<p><i>To increase.</i>&mdash;To make a stitch.</p>

<p><i>To decrease.</i>&mdash;To knit two stitches, taken
together, in one.</p>

<p><i>To knit two together.</i>&mdash;To knit two stitches,
taken together, in one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span></p>

<p><i>Knitting and pearling in the same row.</i>&mdash;When
the stitch, next after a pearled stitch, is
to be knitted, it is obvious that the thread
must be passed back <em>under</em> the needle, before
this can be done;&mdash;in like manner, when a
stitch is to be pearled, after a knitted stitch,
the thread must be brought in front <em>under</em> the
needle;&mdash;processes, however, very different
from those of <em>passing the thread over</em>, and
<em>bringing the thread forward</em>, both of which
are for the purpose of <em>making</em> a stitch, and
are done <em>above</em> the needle.</p>

<p><i>To slip, or pass a stitch.</i>&mdash;To change it from
one needle to the other, <em>without</em> knitting it.</p>

<p><i>To fasten on.</i>&mdash;The best way to fasten on,
is to place the two ends contrariwise, and knit
a few stitches with both together: but, when
knitting with silk, or fine cotton, a <em>weaver’s</em>
knot will be found the best.</p>

<p><i>A Loop Stitch.</i>&mdash;Made by bringing the
thread before the needle, which, in knitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
the succeeding stitch, will again take its own
place.</p>

<p><i>Pearl, seam, and rib-stitch.</i>&mdash;All signify the
same.</p>

<p>It appears almost unnecessary to observe
that, in some of the directions, in order to avoid
repetition, the following mode of abbreviation
has been adopted.&mdash;When a part of a row, or
round, only is to be repeated, it is separated
from the preceding part, by a letter of the
alphabet, inserted in smaller type, between two
brackets; thus,&mdash;repeat from (<span class="label">a</span>) signifies that
the part placed next after (<span class="label">a</span>) alone is to be
repeated. Further, to prevent confusion, when
it was necessary to employ such an abbreviation
more than once in the same directions,
the other letters of the alphabet, in a similar
manner, have been taken in their order of
succession.</p>

<p>N.B. The <em>sizes</em> of the <em>needles</em> are given
according to the <em>Standard Filière</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span></p>

<p>It is necessary, in giving or following directions
for knitting, to caution knitters to observe
a medium in their work&mdash;not knitting either
too loosely or too tightly.</p>

<p>Knit fifty rounds, as at the <a href="#Row_23_1st" title="Go to first row">commencement</a>.</p>

<p>N.B. Every twenty-three rounds should be
alternately black and scarlet; hence the sock
will be formed of three stripes of black, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
three of scarlet, of an equal width, finished
at the top with a half stripe of black. The
widest part, which forms the bottom or foot
of the sock, should be sewn, or loosely knitted,
up. A leathern sole, if desired, may
afterwards be attached. This sock, although
when in the hand it does not exhibit much
form, when drawn over the foot will be found
to fit exactly to its shape.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;The above directions are for a
full-sized lady’s sock. If larger needles and
coarser wool be employed, the knitting will
be still more elastic, and a fewer number of
stitches will be required. The same directions,
with a change of material, are equally adapted
for a large loose night, or bath, sock. With a
fewer number of stitches, but observing the
same relative proportions throughout, most
comfortable and warm leggings, for drawing
over infants’ shoes, may be made, which are
not apt either to roll over, or slip off.</p>

<h2>A Travelling Cap.</h2>

<p>This cap may be knitted with double German
wool, in five shades of any light colour,
and white.&mdash;Needles, No. 8.</p>

<p>Cast on one hundred and two stitches, with
the darkest shade of colour.&mdash;Knit one plain
row to form an edge. Then, commence the
pattern (formed of four rows) as follows.</p>

<p>N.B. The first stitch of each row is always
to be knitted.</p>

<p><i>First row</i>&mdash;knit two together.</p>

<p><i>Second row</i>&mdash;make one between each stitch,
by taking up the wool between the stitches of
the preceding row;&mdash;except between the two
last stitches.</p>

<p><i>Third row</i>&mdash;plain knitting.</p>

<p><i>Fourth row</i>&mdash;pearl knitting.&mdash;The change
of shade is always to be made in this row.</p>

<p>Repeat the above, four times, taking a
lighter shade of wool for each pattern. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
work <em>one pattern</em> in <em>white</em>,&mdash;and repeat the
five coloured patterns, reversing the shades,
by commencing with the lightest. The fourth
row of the eleventh pattern is to be omitted,
in place of which one row must be pearled in
<em>white</em>,&mdash;in order to bring the knitting on the
outer side of the cap.</p>

<p>The front, or roll part, is now completed,
which, when the cap is finished, should be
turned over from the centre pattern of white.</p>

<p>Knit <em>one pattern</em> in <em>white</em>, leaving twenty
stitches unknit, at the end of the fourth
row.&mdash;Knit a <em>second pattern</em>, the same, leaving
twenty stitches unknit, at the end of the
first row; and, in the succeeding rows, making
a stitch between the last two stitches; also, at
the end of the second row, leaving twenty-two
stitches unknit; and, at the ends of the
third, and fourth, rows, leaving twenty-six
stitches unknit.</p>

<p>Knit a <em>third pattern</em> in <em>white</em>, leaving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
twenty-six stitches unknit at the end of the
first three rows; but, in the fourth row, pearl
all the stitches to the end of the needle.</p>

<p>Knit a <em>fourth pattern</em> in <em>white</em>;&mdash;in the first
row of this, knit all the stitches to the other end
of the needle; but, at the end of the third row,
leave twenty stitches unknit. Pearl the fourth
row, with the third shade of the coloured wool,
leaving twenty stitches unknit, at the end.</p>

<p>Knit <em>three</em> more <em>patterns</em> in <em>colours</em>,&mdash;(the
centre being darker than the other two) leaving
one stitch more unknit, at the end of each
row. The fourth row of the third pattern is
to be pearled in white.</p>

<p>Knit <em>seven patterns</em> in <em>white</em>, leaving one
stitch unknit at the end of each row; and also,
omitting to make a stitch between the first
two, and last two, stitches of the second row.</p>

<p>When the seventh pattern is completed,
there should be only eight stitches on the
needle: with these eight, knit <em>one pattern</em>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
and, at the end of the pearled row, pass the
last stitch, before knitting, on to the other
needle; then knit it, together with two of those
before left unknit,&mdash;three in one.</p>

<p>Proceed in the like manner, at the end of
the next, or double stitch row, and continue
the same, until <em>seven patterns</em> are finished,
from the above eight stitches.</p>

<p>Before commencing the last pearled row,
fasten on the third shade of coloured wool, and
pearl to the end of the row. Then, knit the
last stitch, together with three of the unknit
stitches,&mdash;four in one. Repeat the same, at
the end of the next row.</p>

<p>In the next pearled row, knit again four
together, as above, and three single stitches
beyond, at the end of the double stitch row:
also, knit four together, and one single, and
two double beyond.</p>

<p>When two patterns, in the third shade, are
completed, fasten on the white wool, and pearl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
a row;&mdash;at the end of this, knit three single
stitches of the unknit beyond. In the next
row,&mdash;knit, alternately, a double and a single
stitch, throughout the row;&mdash;knitting the last
stitch, together with one row of the unknit,
and two single ones beyond.</p>

<p>In the next row, make a stitch between each,
as usual; and, at the end of the next pearled
row, knit three single stitches beyond. Work
the three next rows as follows:</p>

<p><i>First</i>&mdash;three double, and one single stitch,
alternately:&mdash;the last must be a double stitch,
and a single stitch beyond.</p>

<p><i>Second</i>&mdash;a stitch between each, and three
single stitches beyond.</p>

<p><i>Third</i>&mdash;plain knitting, and three single
stitches beyond.</p>

<p>Before commencing the next pearled row,
fasten on the darkest coloured wool; knit a
pattern quite to the end of each needle, and
fasten off,&mdash;omitting the pearled row.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span></p>

<p>The cord for tieing this cap may be made
by plaiting one light-coloured, and two dark-coloured,
threads of wool together; each thread
consisting of four plies of German wool. One
cord passes across the front of the cap, under
the chin, and another round the caul, with a
bow at the side: the ends finishing with a
tassel of white wool.&mdash;Ribands, which are prettier,
may be substituted.</p>

cast off three patterns; and unravel the remainder
for the fringe.</p>

<p>Before unravelling, the knitting should be
thoroughly damped, and afterwards dried before
a fire. This will cause the wool to curl,
and form a better fringe. Each loop should
be knotted, close to the knitting.</p>

<p>It is advisable to knit this fringe in one
length. It may be easily made to sit well

<h2>D’Oyleys.</h2>

<p>These D’Oyleys, as nearly as the patterns will
allow, work about six inches square; they have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
an open border, with a plain edge of three
stitches, on each side. Some of the centres are
arranged to contain a certain number of <em>perfect</em>
patterns; but others, where such an arrangement
would have interfered with the
symmetry of the borders, are curtailed of a few
stitches:&mdash;thus, No. <span class="smcap"><abbr title="4">IV.</abbr></span> contains four perfect
patterns, each composed of fifteen stitches; and
one pattern of thirteen stitches only&mdash;the open
part of the pattern, on one side, being omitted.</p>

<p>In addition to the borders above mentioned,
these D’Oyleys should be trimmed with a netted
scalloped edging, or, with one of the knitted
edgings to be found in this book: a coarse lace,
however, if preferred, will equally answer the
purpose.</p>

<p>As the first twelve rows&mdash;composing the
border&mdash;of each D’Oyley, are the same, the repetition
of them, in each pattern, appears useless;
the following directions, therefore, will
serve for the commencement of all, and form&mdash;</p>

<h2>A Warm Habit Shirt.</h2>

<p>A warm habit-shirt, for wearing either over,
or under, the dress, may be made with three-thread
fleecy.&mdash;Needles, No. 12.</p>

<p>The border should be worked in a different
colour to that of the other part.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span></p>

<p>Cast on thirty-six stitches,&mdash;with the border
colour. Knit twelve plain rows.</p>

<p>This completes the border at the waist.
In the next row&mdash;knit eight,&mdash;with the first
colour,&mdash;for the border at the side; then,&mdash;with
the other colour,&mdash;knit four, pearl
four, alternately, for the next twenty stitches;
knit eight,&mdash;with the first colour,&mdash;for the
border on the other side. Knit three more
rows, in a similar manner,&mdash;observing to
make a stitch, between the border and the
pattern, at the commencement of every row.</p>

<p>Work four similar rows, but alternating the
stitches, by pearling on the knitted stitches, and
knitting on the pearled stitches, of the previous
four rows,&mdash;so as to form a checked pattern.</p>

<p>Repeat the last eight rows, alternately four
and four, until twenty patterns in height be
worked; when twenty-five patterns in width
should count on the needle.</p>

<p>Pass forty stitches from one side, on to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
another needle; leaving (when the same number
shall have been passed off from the other
side), nine patterns, or thirty-six stitches, for
the back of the shirt.</p>

<p>Knit, on the forty stitches, one of the two
pieces, that pass over the shoulders and form
the front of the shirt, as follows.</p>

<p>N.B. The border (of eight stitches) is continued
on the <em>outer</em> side at the same time.
The borders, at the top of the back, and
of the <em>inner</em> sides of the front pieces, are
knitted afterwards.</p>

<p>Knit four patterns, increasing on one side
only&mdash;between the pattern and outer border.</p>

<p>Knit four patterns, increasing, as before, on
the outer side, between the pattern and the
border; and plain knitting four stitches on the
<em>inner</em> side of every row.</p>

<p>N.B. The four plain stitches on the <em>inner</em>
side of the row are now to be repeated on
every succeeding row.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span></p>

<p>Work a sufficient number of rows to complete
this portion of the front of the shirt;
decreasing on every row, between the pattern
and the four plain stitches, on the <em>inner</em> side.
Between the border and the pattern, on the
<em>outer</em> side, bring the wool forward, and knit two
together, to preserve the open edge, formed
by the increasing, in the previous rows.</p>

<p>Work a corresponding front piece, on the
other side, in the same manner. Then,&mdash;</p>

<p>On the inner sides of the front ends, and
back of neck, take up two stitches on every
square; knit round, bringing the wool forward,
before every stitch, except on the thirty-six
stitches of the <em>back</em>&mdash;which knit plain.</p>

<p>Knit eight plain rows.</p>

<p>In the next row&mdash;knit to within three patterns
of the back; cast off as far as three patterns
beyond the back on the other side; knit
the remaining stitches to the end of the row.</p>

<p>Knit eight plain rows, on the remaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
stitches, at either side; decreasing one stitch
at the beginning of every row.</p>

<p>Take up the stitches of the inner, and outer,
borders at the ends of the front sides, and knit
the corners, by decreasing two stitches in the
centre of every row.</p>

<h2>A Polka Riding, or Yacht, Jacket.</h2>

<p>These coats are made with sleeves and
collar; they descend about twelve inches
below the waist, and form very comfortable
warm wrappers, fitting tight to the figure.
They should be knitted in a dark rich colour,
with a border, about four inches deep, in black
or white. If the border be white, small black
worsted tufts, in imitation of ermine, may be
added. According to the following improved
method of working this jacket, it is divided
into three portions,&mdash;the body, the sleeves,
and the collar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span></p>

<p>N.B. The whole of the knitting is in <em>Brioche</em>
stitch; that is,&mdash;bring the wool forward, slip
one, knit two together.</p>

<p>Commence with the border, at the lower
part of the jacket, by casting on&mdash;with <em>white</em>&mdash;two
hundred and eighty-eight stitches.&mdash;Four-thread
fleecy.&mdash;Needles, No. 9, or 10.</p>

<p>Knit thirty rows&mdash;<em>white</em>. Pass off seven <em>ribs</em>,
on either side, on to a string; and, on the remaining
stitches, knit eighteen rows&mdash;<em>coloured</em>.</p>

<p>On the <em>nineteenth</em> (coloured) <em>row</em>&mdash;knit
fifteen ribs; decrease one <em>rib</em>, by knitting
three stitches in one;&mdash;knit forty-seven ribs;
decrease one <em>rib</em>, as before; knit the remaining
fifteen ribs.</p>

<p>Knit one hundred rows,&mdash;decreasing on
every twentieth row, in the same manner and
place.</p>

<p>In the next row&mdash;knit fifteen ribs; decrease
one rib; then, decrease on every fifth rib,
until within fifteen ribs of the end of row.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span></p>

<p>Knit fifty rows. Then&mdash;</p>

<p>Pass off the outer thirteen ribs, on either
side, on to a string: and cast off the next four
ribs, on either side, to form the arm holes.</p>

<p>Knit fifty rows on the remaining stitches of
the back. This brings the knitting to the
shoulder.</p>

<p>In the next <em>ten</em> rows, leave two ribs unknit,
at the beginning of the first two rows;&mdash;two
more, at the second two rows;&mdash;two more, at
the third two rows;&mdash;two more, at the fourth
two rows;&mdash;and two more at the fifth two rows.</p>

<p>Knit two rows on the remaining stitches.</p>

<p>Knit the same number of rows, on the
thirteen ribs of each side of the front that
were passed on to the string; decreasing on
the sides next the shoulders, in the same
manner as directed for the back.</p>

<p>The slanting edges of the back and fronts
are to be sewn together,&mdash;to form the shoulder
and arm holes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span></p>

<p>Take up the white ribs that were passed off,
on either side, and&mdash;with <em>white</em>&mdash;knit a sufficient
number of rows to form the borders for
the fronts.</p>

<p>For the <em>collar</em>,&mdash;cast on ninety-six stitches&mdash;<em>white</em>.
Knit eight rows. Then, knit twelve
rows&mdash;<em>coloured</em>. Knit one plain row. Cast
off,&mdash;and sew the collar to the neck of the
jacket.</p>

<p>For the <em>sleeves</em>,&mdash;cast on one hundred and
thirteen stitches&mdash;<em>coloured</em>.&mdash;Knit four rows.
On the fifth row, leave two ribs unknit at the
end; and, on every succeeding second row,
leave two other ribs unknit;&mdash;so that, on the
twenty-seventh row, there will be twenty-four
ribs unknit, at the end. Knit one hundred
and two rows,&mdash;knitting all the stitches on
the needle&mdash;and cast off.</p>

<p>Cast on twenty-one stitches for the <em>cuff</em>&mdash;<em>white</em>.&mdash;Knit
seventy-four rows. Sew the
cuff to the narrow end of the sleeve. Then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>

<p>Commence again, as at <a href="#Round_119_1st" title="Go to first row">first round</a>; but, in
order to keep the pattern in a slanting direction,
the stitch that the slip-stitch was passed
over in the previous row, must be made the
first knit stitch, bringing the last of the former
knitted stitches in the open part.</p>

<p>When a sufficient number of patterns have
been knitted, to form a bolster of the desired
length, it is to be drawn up at the ends, and
soft tassels added. As the pattern is open, a
bright coloured silk lining looks best;&mdash;cerise
or blue, for instance, with the knitting in white.
The bolster should be stuffed with down, or
soft wool.</p>

<p>“A fourth edition of a book, that every buyer puts to the test by
proving its utility and efficiency, is the best kind of praise; and leaves for us
only to record the facts, that this new edition is improved as well as amplified,
and at the same time reduced in price without being less handsome than
before.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Spectator.</span></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Miss Lambert’s</span> works on the art of needlework, bear a high character,
especially for the distinctness and precision of their directions.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">English
Churchman.</span></p>

when the party consulting it desires instruction, and amusing whenever she
is weary of work.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Athenæum.</span></p>

<p>“The most curious, complete, and erudite treatise on the art of needlework
that has ever been compiled.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Atlas.</span></p>

directions, natural in its arrangements. The style is simple and easy; the
collateral information abundant.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Polytechnic Review.</span></p>

the manner, in which, in this instance, certain technical instructions are conveyed,

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
